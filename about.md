Welcome to my website. My name is Austin Godber. I have a bachelors in
[Physics](http://phy.asu.edu/) from [Arizona State
University](http://www.asu.edu/). I am a Linux geek by day ... and not
surprisingly a Linux geek by night. I have worked no DARPA sponsored
computer security projects, helped start a Municipal WiFi company,
assisted NASA's [Mars Spaceflight Facility](http://www.mars.asu.edu/) in
surviving the Slashdot effect and wrangled virtual penguins for
[JumpBox](http://www.jumpbox.com/).

I am also involved in running the [Phoenix area Python User Group:
DesertPy](http://desertpy.com).
